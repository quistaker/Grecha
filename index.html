                    Bottom line: nutrients before treats. Because the foods above aren’t part of a complete and balanced diet for felines, there’s no need to go out of your way to get your cat to eat them.

                    How to properly walk a cat?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Here's part of an article from a blog by a girl from Toronto who regularly walks her cat.
                </p>
                <h4>Step 1: Get outside!</h4>
                <p>
                    I'll be honest with you. When we (myself & cat dad) decided that we were going to introduce Gibson to the outdoors, we were not prepared. We did not have a harness or leash but what we did have was a carrier! So, out we went just 12 days after bringing him home. We wanted to first give him some time to adjust to his new environment. Once he got comfortable inside I began following his lead outside to see if he'd be down for the adventure sort of life. To give you some context, we live in the City of Toronto on a busy street. I knew that he had to get used to the noises of traffic so I loaded him up in his carrier, ensured that he was comfortable with blankets to hide under if he was scared, and sat down beside him on the ledge right next to all the traffic going by. He observed, hid when he got startled, observed again, jolted at the loud noises that passed him by, and continued this cycle as we sat there for just 15-20 minutes for a few days. I reassured him that he was okay and I really felt that he knew it would be.
                </p>
                <h4>Step 2: Get comfortable!</h4>
                <p>
                    Another very popular comment we get is, "I tried putting a harness on my cat but they hated it!" My question to this would then be, "did you put it on more than just once?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Often the answer is "no, not really". Now, when a child is taught how to walk and they fall or cry you don't hear parents say, "well, they hated it so I guess they'll just crawl forever". Gibson HATED the harness when we first put it on. We decided to use the harness from CatIt (size small) which you can find on Amazon. It was hard finding a harness that fit him because he was just a kitten but this one seemed to adjust and fit him best. When we first put the harness on we spent some time with him wearing it indoors to prepare for it on in the outdoors. What that meant for him was consistently choosing a frame of time every day to put the harness on him daily until he could walk around as if it wasn't even on.
                </p>
                <p>“Allow time to let the harness and cat become one.”</p>
                <p>
                    It's important to do this inside where your cat already feels confident and also helps to redirect their attention to other things they enjoy while they have the harness on, such as eating and playing. This will really help to set them up for a win when you begin taking them outside.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Designating one area to be his "safe zone" was also key in making our time outside positive. As you'll be able to see from the video below, he became quite confident in discovering this new world around him; almost TOO confident. I am a RECE (registered early childhood educator) and work with children and families. I once heard of a parent who had to take their child to physiotherapy because their child was walking before they could crawl. They actually skipped a very important step in learning how to walk, which was crawling. It's in this stage that a child develops the muscle needed to be able to walk properly.

                <p>
                    With Gibson I wanted to limit his discovering to the porch so that he'd see this place as a space that did not harm or scare him so that in the event of a loud vehicle driving by he knew that he could go somewhere safe. I wanted him to work his 'safety muscle' before he got into exploring. I wanted him to first trust the sounds, sights and surroundings of the outdoors with me by his side before he went somewhere he'd never been before and spook himself from any sudden noises, movements or scenes.
                </p>
                <h4>Step 3: Have fun!</h4>
                <p>
                    The last thing you want to do while being out and about is to put pressure on yourself and your cat. Comparing them to other cat explorers also doesn't help to make things enjoyable if that's all you are focused on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, always make every effort possible to let your outdoor time be positive. Why? Because cats are great at remembering and holding onto negative experiences which might render them fearful of the outside world. It can also cause long-term behaviours that will cause your cat to avoid certain situations that can be unavoidable while exploring.

                        Having a bunch of cats around is good. If you're feeling bad, just look at the cats, you'll feel better, because they know that everything is, just as it is.
